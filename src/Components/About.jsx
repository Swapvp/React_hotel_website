            The Cosmopolitan Hotels were born from the idea of bringing together
            people from a multi cultural hot pot into a common place and
            connecting them, very much like a city. It grew from the idea of how
            when we travel in trains we strike up a conversation with our fellow
            passengers. It could be anything - from the weather, to politics,
            movies to food. Sometimes entire conversations flow even without
            exchange of names.
          </p>
          <p>
            The culture of connecting with people in the physical world is
            slowly waning. We at Cosmopolitan Hotels aim to foster and reignite
            the charm of meeting different people on one's sojourns. People have
            an instinct about whom they would like to interact with and whom
            they don't, but in today's busy world, this opportunity of
            interaction and meeting new people is there only when one is
            travelling. Cosmopolitan would like our guests to make the most of
            it by creating the social environment. Our Hotel lobbies are
            designed to be casual, quirky and laid back. The sophistication of a
            premium Hotel is not there but the easy going atmosphere of a homely
            cafe is provided at the lobby itself.

            Our restaurants are all having projectors and screens to bring
            together people over sports, music and any other performances.
            Common interests often help people break the ice and connect more
            easily.

            We, at the same time, respect each individual's privacy and need to
            be focused on their own work/activity. Hence we take your request to
            connect or be alone right at the time of check in itself. We
            accordingly involve you or not in our social cafe evenings.{" "}
